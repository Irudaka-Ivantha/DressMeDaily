The "Dress Me Daily" app is a comprehensive tool for daily outfit selection, comprising three main parts: frontend, backend, and data science. The front end, built with Dart and Flutter, offers a user interface for setting preferences, viewing recommendations, and wardrobe management. The backend, developed in Python and Firebase, manages data, including user profiles and outfits, and integrates with the Weather API for current conditions. The data science core, also Python-based using TensorFlow and Keras, powers image recognition and recommendation systems that analyze wardrobes and suggest outfits based on user tastes and weather. 
The app employs a CI/CD pipeline for deployment and Git for version control, showcasing a successful blend of technologies for enhanced outfit-choosing convenience.

limitations & Future enhancements 
The team identified several future enhancements that can be made to the application. Learning and doing more research on the 2D model and integrating that with the application. Further enhancing the recommendation and integrating the user’s wardrobe with the recommendation dataset. Also, we are planning to make the application more smoother and appealing. These changes will make the “DressMeDaily” application more user-friendly and useful. The team will make these changes as soon as possible.
